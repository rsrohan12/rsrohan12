# Hi, I'm Rohan Thakur 👋

🚀 Full-Stack Software Developer  
📍 Jalandhar, Punjab, India

I’m a full-stack developer with experience working on **production systems across two remote teams**. I enjoy building scalable web applications, improving system performance, and working close to real-world engineering problems. I’m particularly interested in backend systems, async processing, and clean, maintainable architecture.
